# Favourite saying

```swift
// Rogina's motto

struct MarkZuckerberg {
    /// Return Mark Zuckerberg quote
    func said() -> String {
        return "You are better off trying something and having it not work and learning from that than not doing anything at all"
    }
}

@main
struct Main {
    static func main() {
        let markZuckerberg = MarkZuckerberg()
        print("mark zuckerberg - \(markZuckerberg.said())")
    }
}
